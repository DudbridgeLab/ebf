\title{EBF bias for binomial tests}
\format{
A vector with the bias for each sample size from 1 to 100.
}
\usage{
binom.bias
}
\description{
Bias in the log posterior marginal likelihood for binomial tests,
used for calculating empirical Bayes factors.
Bias is computed by the \code{\link{compute.binom.bias}} function using enumeration.
Sample sizes range from 1 to 100.
The uniform prior is used.
}
\details{
The bias depends on the true success probability.
As this is unknown, the bias is maximised over the probability to give
a conservative estimate.
