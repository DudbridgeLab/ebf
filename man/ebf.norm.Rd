\description{
Calculates empirical Bayes factors (EBFs) for tests of a scalar normal mean
with known variance.
}
\details{
EBFs are calculated in favour of \code{h1}.

The default test has \code{h0=0}, with two-sided alternative.
For one-sided alternatives, use \code{h1=c(0,Inf)} or \code{h1=c(-Inf,0)}.
To test positive values against negative values, use \code{h0=c(-Inf,0)},
in which case \code{h1} defaults to \code{c(0,Inf)}.
To test negative values against positive values, use \code{h0=c(0,Inf)}.

For shrinkage EBFs, each test is evaluated using the posterior distribution
obtained from every other test.
The calculation may be time-consuming when the number of tests is large.
To reduce the computation a subset of tests can be used instead,
with indices specified in \code{points}.  Each individual test is appended
to this list as it is evaluated.

Further reduction can be achieved by calculating EBFs only for the elements
of \code{x} given by \code{index}.  The posterior distribution is still calculated using all
the points in \code{x}, or those specified in \code{points}.

For test \code{i}, the contributions from tests \code{j!=i} can be weighted
by \code{pi0} to model the probability that the hypothesis is true for those
other tests.  The default \code{pi0=0} assumes that the hypothesis is true
for all tests.  If \code{pi0=1}, the single-test EBF is recovered.
