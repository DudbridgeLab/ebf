\title{EBF bias for negative binomial tests}
\format{
A vector with the bias for each sample size from 1 to 100.
}
\usage{
nbinom.bias
}
\description{
Bias in the log posterior marginal likelihood for negative binomial tests,
used for calculating empirical Bayes factors.
Bias is computed by the \code{\link{compute.nbinom.bias}} function using Monte Carlo simulation.
Minimum sample sizes (ie fixed number of events) range from 1 to 100.
The uniform prior is used.
